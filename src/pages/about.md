## Hello!

My name is Jose Castaneyra, and I'm a Software Engineer (previously for a couple of years a Cloud Engineer).

A long time ago I had a blog, but I didn't update it for about eight years, I am trying to start again, definitely
this site will have technical content about what I am doing and some references about me and my career, I said in my old blog that was a repo of ideas, this will be something similar but skipping the personal stuff.

So, get back soon!

HEY!! in case you are looking my old blog, you can find it here => [http://old.jcastaneyra.com](http://old.jcastaneyra.com)
