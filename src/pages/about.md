## Hello!

My name is Jose Castaneyra, and I'm a Software Engineer (previously for a couple of years a Cloud Engineer).

Long time ago I had also a blog, but this wasn't updated for about eight years, I am trying to start again, definitely
this site will have technical content about what I am doing and some references about me and my career, I said in my old blog that was a repo of ideas, this will be something similar but skipping the personal stuff.

So, get back soon!
